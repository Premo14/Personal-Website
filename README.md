## Techniques

- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**: Implemented lazy-loaded routes using `React Router` and `React.lazy` to reduce initial bundle size.
- **Nested Routing**: Utilized `React Router` to manage hierarchical UI and route structures cleanly.
- **Form Validation with Schema Support**: Used `react-hook-form` with validation libraries (like `Zod` or `Yup`) for performant, accessible forms.
- **API Caching & Background Refetching**: Leveraged `React Query` to handle server state, caching responses and auto-refetching on focus or network reconnection.
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Enabled snappy UX with `React Query` by applying optimistic updates during mutations.
- **Debounced Search Requests**: Applied debouncing in combination with `React Query` for responsive and efficient search experiences.
- **Custom React Hooks**: Encapsulated repeated logic (e.g. data fetching, form handling) into clean, reusable hooks.
- **Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS**: Used utility-first styling and responsive classes for a mobile-first layout.
- **Docker Multi-Stage Builds**: Built smaller and more secure production images using Docker's multi-stage builds.
- **Infrastructure as Code with Terraform**: Defined and provisioned AWS resources (EC2, S3, Route 53, etc.) via version-controlled Terraform scripts.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Set up automated testing, build, and deployment workflows triggered on `push` to `main`.
- **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Managed environment variables and secrets for dev/prod environments using Docker and Terraform best practices.
- **Database Migrations**: Managed schema changes in PostgreSQL via GORMâ€™s auto-migrations or manual scripts.
